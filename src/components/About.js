                As the saying goes, the pen is mightier than the sword. But Id also venture that the pen can be mightier than the keyboard. After spending hours each day typing out emails, text messages, tweets, Facebook comments and instant messages using similarly dull fonts, the sight of anything written in another persons handwriting can be quaintly touching.


                The Targus iNotebook consists of a notebook case, a customized pen and a paper notebook. A sensor bar above the pad receives signals from the pen as it is used and can wirelessly beam what is written to the iPad.
                For the past week, Ive tried using a tool from Targus that breathes digital life into good old handwriting. Its the iNotebook, a $180 gadget that digitizes and saves words written on regular paper to the iPad.

                Using a free, iPad-only app called iNotebook, people can sort their handwritten notes into various notebooks, tabs and pages. They can enhance their notes with cool background images, highlighted text, stamps and different text colors. Audio recordings can be added to notes, and notes can be saved to Dropbox or emailed to friends.

                While the iNotebook is definitely a niche product, its fun to use and more satisfying than writing on a glass tablet surface using a stylus. People who primarily rely on handwritten notes — whether because they can write faster or because they like making quick annotations or drawings with their notes — will want to consider this device.

                But its $180 price tag, which is over half the cost of the iPad Mini, will scare buyers off. And in a few instances, the iNotebook pen was a little flaky.
